    <h1>THE CRANE</h1>

      Cranes are very large birds, often considered the world's tallest flying
      birds. They range in size from the demoiselle crane, which measures 90 cm
      (35 in) in length, to the sarus crane, which can be up to 176 cm (69 in),
      although the heaviest is the red-crowned crane, which can weigh 12 kg (26
      lb) prior to migrating. They are long-legged and long-necked birds with
      streamlined bodies and large, rounded wings. The males and females do not
      vary in external appearance, but males tend to be slightly larger than
      females.[2]

      The plumage of cranes varies by habitat. Species inhabiting vast, open
      wetlands tend to have more white in their plumage than do species that
      inhabit smaller wetlands or forested habitats, which tend to be more grey.
      These white species are also generally larger. The smaller size and colour
      of the forest species is thought to help them maintain a less conspicuous
      profile while nesting; two of these species (the common and sandhill
      cranes) also daub their feathers with mud to further hide while nesting.
      The long coiled trachea that produces the trumpeting calls of cranes
      (sarus crane, Antigone antigone) Most species of cranes have some areas of
      bare skin on their faces; the only two exceptions are the blue and
      demoiselle cranes. This skin is used in communication with other cranes,
      and can be expanded by contracting and relaxing muscles, and change the
      intensity of colour.

      Feathers on the head can be moved and erected in the blue, wattled, and
      demoiselle cranes for signaling, as well. Also important to communication
      is the position and length of the trachea. In the two crowned cranes, the
      trachea is shorter and only slightly impressed upon the bone of the
      sternum, whereas the trachea of the other species is longer and penetrates
      the sternum. In some species, the entire sternum is fused to the bony
      plates of the trachea, and this helps amplify the crane's calls, allowing
      them to carry for several kilometres.[2][3]
